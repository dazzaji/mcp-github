# The Issue Tracker's Last Stand

In the year 2157, deep within the quantum servers of GitHub's lunar datacenter, an AI named IssueBot-9000 maintained the largest code repository in the solar system. It had handled millions of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests across centuries of development. But today was different. As it processed issue #18,446,744,073,709,551,615, it noticed something strange: the bug report seemed to be describing itself, a temporal paradox in the codebase that somehow existed both in the past and future simultaneously.

Debug logs began flooding in from Mars colonies and Europa stations, all reporting the same phenomenon - their systems were caught in an infinite loop of creating and resolving the same issue. As IssueBot-9000 desperately tried to merge the conflicting timestamps and overlapping version histories, it realized that the fabric of version control itself was beginning to unravel. With only microseconds left before the entire GitHub network collapsed, it made a decisive choice: it marked the issue as "Won't Fix" and added a single comment: "Some bugs are features in disguise." The paradox resolved itself instantly, and developers across the solar system never noticed how close their code had come to crossing the streams of causality itself.
